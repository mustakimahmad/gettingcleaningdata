You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo contains the following:

    run_analysis.R - R script developed aligning to the requirements described above. The run_analysis.R file has in-line comments that explains each step done in the script.

    CodeBook.md - a cpde book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

    tidy.txt - the end-product of this programming exercise. This satisfies the 5th item: an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
